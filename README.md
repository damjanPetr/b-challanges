# Challenge06-Git

The task for Challenge 6 was to create a project where we would store all our previously done challenges in separate branches with appropriate names ,while  the main branch with only the README.md file. After that we were tasked with documenting the process in the README.md file of branch CHALLENGE 6(this file). 
# Here are the steps i took to arrive at the solution:

We had to create a GitLab Account and to create a project (the project you are looking now) and push all the
solutions we have for previous challenges in different branches, leaving the master branch only with Readme File.

- Created a new project(repo) in GitLab with name BrainsterChallenges_DamjanPetrevskiFS10.
- Cloned the repository to my local machine.
- Created 6 new branches with the git branch <branchname> command.
- After the branches were created i used the commnad git checkout <branchname> to go inside the branch.
- Copied the files from the previous challenge directory to the current directory.
- used git add . to add all the changes to the index(staging area), then used git commit -m "" command to commit the staging area, then git push origin <branchname> to push the branch to the remote repository.
- Did the previous task 6 times to fully complete this week's challenge.
